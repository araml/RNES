short reference on the ppu (our registers are mappd to the memory as if they were a single latch, the ppu then must reinterpret what happened last and act accordingly. 
(read write status are for the CPU only).

ppuctrl     (register, read).
    no reg update (just internal)
ppumask     (register, read).
    no reg update.

ppustatus   (register, read):
    Status on sprite overflow and vertical blank.
    Reading this register will clear the ppuaddr and ppuscroll latchs.

oamaddr     (port, write):
    Some weird case between oam and oamaddr, when oamaddr < 8.

oamdata     (port, read/write):
    Writes to oamdata increment oamaddr. 

ppuscroll   (reg, write[twice]):
    Cpu writes to this register to scroll the map.

ppuaddr     (reg, write[twice]):
    After reading ppustatus the CPU can write to ppuaddr the two bytes for an adress in vram.

ppudata     (reg, read/write):
    After the CPU reads this register the ppu must update the actual value with the adress indicated by ppuaddr.

oamdma      (reg, write):
    This register is used to indicate the page that will be copied through a dma to the oam memory of the ppu.
